# RCCServiceLocator Prototype
Service locator Android app prototype made with the Xamarin framework.\
Commissioned by the Redland Community Center dubbed "Homeless on Bayside", as the intended target audience was homeless people looking for services in the bayside area.\
The prototype was created for my QUT capstone project and developed over the course of a semester.\

### Features
- SQLite Database to store service data
- Google maps for navigation to services (No longer functions as google api key is no longer valid)
- Links that autofill apps with service information such as dialers and internet browsers
